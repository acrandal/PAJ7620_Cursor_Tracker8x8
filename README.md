# PSJ7620_Cursor_Tracker8x8

This is a simple example project using the PAJ7620 gesture sensor.
It uses the sensor's cursor mode to find an object in view's X and Y coordinates.
These coordinates are translated to an index of an RGB LED 8x8 array.
This way your "cursor" (finger, usually) is rendered on the 8x8 array as a single pixel.

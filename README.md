# PAJ7620 Cursor Tracker 8x8

This is a simple example project using the PAJ7620 gesture sensor.
It uses the sensor's cursor mode to find an object in view's X and Y coordinates.
These coordinates are translated to an index of an RGB LED 8x8 array.
This way your "cursor" (finger, usually) is rendered on the 8x8 array as a single pixel.

The current version has upgraded to leaving a fading trail of pixels behind your cursor's path.

The project uses a demo kit of:
- Arduino Uno
- PAJ7620U2 breakout board
- WS2812B (NeoPixel) 8x8 RGB LED Array
- Breadboard and jumper wires
